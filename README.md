# Quiz Master!

Quiz Master is Quipper's technical test. It is a standard Ruby-on-Rails app using RSpec test framework. The website allows users to create test questions and answers.


## To attempt and submit this test.

1. Clone master branch, start rails server, and begin making your changes.

2. When you are finished, make a patch with `git format-patch`, and then send them to us via email. 

## Specifications

1. There is no implementation for answering a question and knowing whether you got the answer right or wrong. Please add such implementation.

2. The Rspec tests currently fail. Please finish the model so that the tests pass.

3. The site's implementation is missing tests. Please provide either controller specs and/or feature specs to test the implementation.

4. Currently the question text is merely plain text. Please add the ability for users to provide some simple formatting.


## Notes

1. You can add any gems that you think are useful for completing the test and improving the site.

2. You can change the interface in any way that you feel may improve the user experience.

3. If you do not like or are not used to HAML, SASS, CoffeeScript etc, you can use whichever technologies you feel more comfortable with.
